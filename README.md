# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results
- In the retiring_titles table we notice that there are around 60,000 people retiring from senior level positions alone
- Also in the retiring_titles table there seem to be only 2 managers retiring.
- In the mentorship_eligibility table, there seems to be 1549 eligible mentors that meet our requirements of age and employment  status.
- Finally, in the unique_titles table, we were able to get the titles of the employees based on their first occurrence of employee number.

## Summary

A total of 90,398 employees are about to retire. This is very crutial because they rate of retiring is more than their replacements
The is issue about mentoring the next class is that we do not have enough of them. Eligibilty need to be more broad range

Eligibilty needs to be expanded to about 3 more years for more mentors!
